# ZenML Pro

The Pro version of ZenML comes with a number of features that expand the functionality of the Open Source product

### Role-based access control and permissions

Utilizing ZenML Cloud provides you with access to a robust control plane that unifies user management and optimizes your workflows. Efficiently manage access and permissions through centralized user administration. Create fine-grained permissions for resources such as stacks, pipelines, models, etc.

See the section on [user management](user-management.md) to learn more.

### A brand-new, modern MLOps experience

We have built the ZenML Cloud from the ground-up. With ZenML Cloud, you get access to a new dashboard, with a better experience. The new dashboard features more functionality such as the [Model Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/track-ml-models.md) and [Artifact Control Plane](../../user-guide/starter-guide/manage-artifacts.md).

### Triggers, CI/CD, Reports and more

Additionally, ZenML Cloud users get exclusive access to an array of cloud-specific features, such as triggering pipelines directly through the dashboard, integrating with your code repository CI/CD system, generating usage reports and more.

Learn more about ZenML Cloud on the [ZenML Website](https://zenml.io/cloud).
