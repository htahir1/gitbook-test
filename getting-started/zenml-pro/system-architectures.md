If you're interested in assessing ZenML Cloud, you can create a [free account](https://cloud.zenml.io/?utm\_source=docs\&utm\_medium=referral\_link\&utm\_campaign=cloud\_promotion\&utm\_content=signup\_link), which defaults to a [Scenario 1](./#scenario-1-full-saas) deployment.

The ZenML Pro offers many additional features to increase your teams productivity. No matter your specific needs, the hosting options for ZenML Pro range from easy SaaS integration to completely airgapped deployments on your own infrastructure.

A ZenML Pro deployment consists of the following moving pieces for both the SaaS product as well as the self-hosted version.:

* **ZenML Cloud API**: This is a centralized MLOps control plane that includes a managed ZenML dashboard and a special ZenML server optimized for production MLOps workloads.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: The ZenML Cloud API is integrated with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as an SSO provider to manage user authentication and authorization. Users can log in to the ZenML Cloud dashboard using their social media accounts or their corporate credentials.
* **Secrets Store**: All secrets and credentials required to access customer infrastructure services are stored in a secure secrets store. The ZenML Cloud API has access to these secrets and uses them to access customer infrastructure services on behalf of the ZenML Cloud. The secrets store can be hosted either by the ZenML Cloud or by the customer.
* **ML Metadata Store**: This is where all ZenML metadata is stored, including ML metadata such as tracking and versioning information about pipelines and models.

The above four interact with other MLOps stack components, secrets, and data in varying scenarios described below.

## Scenario 1: Full SaaS

![Scenario 1: Full SaaS deployment](../../.gitbook/assets/cloud\_architecture\_scenario\_1.png)

In this scenario, all services are hosted on the ZenML Cloud infrastructure. Customer secrets and credentials required to access customer infrastructure are stored and managed by the ZenML Cloud.

On our infrastructure for ZenML Cloud only ML _metadata_ (e.g. pipeline and model tracking and versioning information) is stored. All the actual ML data artifacts (e.g. data produced or consumed by pipeline steps, logs and visualizations, models) are stored on the customer cloud. This can be set up quite easily by configuring an [artifact store](../../stack-components/artifact-stores/) with your MLOps stack.

Your tenant only needs permissions to read from this data to display artifacts on the ZenML dashboard. The tenant also needs direct access to parts of the customer infrastructure services to support dashboard control plane features such as CI/CD, triggering and running pipelines, triggering model deployments etc.

This scenario is meant for customers who want to quickly get started with ZenML and can to a certain extent allow ingress connections into their infrastructure from an external SaaS provider.

## Scenario 2: Hybrid SaaS with Customer Secret Store managed by ZenML

![Scenario 2: Hybrid SaaS with Customer Secret Store managed by ZenML](../../.gitbook/assets/cloud\_architecture\_scenario\_2.png)

This scenario is a version of Scenario 1. modified to store all sensitive information on the customer side. In this case, the customer connects their own secret store directly to the ZenML server that is managed by us. All ZenML secrets used by running pipelines to access infrastructure services and resources are stored in the customer secret store. This allows users to use [service connectors](../../how-to/auth-management/service-connectors-guide.md) and the [secrets API](../../how-to/interact-with-secrets.md) to authenticate ZenML pipelines and the ZenML Cloud to 3rd party services and infrastructure while ensuring that credentials are always stored on the customer side.

Even though they are stored customer side, access to ZenML secrets is fully managed by the ZenML Cloud. The ZenML Cloud is also allowed to use some of those credentials to connect directly to customer infrastructure services to implement control plane features such as artifact visualization or triggering pipelines. This implies that the secret values are allowed to leave the customer environment to allow their access to be managed centrally by the ZenML Cloud and to enforce access control policies, but the ZenML users and pipelines never have direct access to the secret store.

All access to customer secrets is, of course, regulated through authentication and RBAC, so that only authorized users can access the secrets. This deployment scenario is meant for customers who want to use the ZenML Cloud but want to keep their secrets on their own infrastructure.

## Scenario 3: Fully On-prem

![Scenario 3: Fully on-premises deployment](../../.gitbook/assets/cloud\_architecture\_scenario\_5.png)

In this scenario, all services, data, and secrets are deployed on the customer cloud. This is the opposite of Scenario 1, and is meant for customers who require completely airgapped deployments, for the tightest security standards.
