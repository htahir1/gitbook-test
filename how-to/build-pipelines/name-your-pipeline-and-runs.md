# Name your pipeline runs

In the output logs of a pipeline run you will see the name of the run:

```bash
Pipeline run training_pipeline-2023_05_24-12_41_04_576473 has finished in 3.742s.
```

This name is automatically generated based on the current date and time. To change the name for a run, pass `run_name` as a parameter to the `with_options()` method:

```python
training_pipeline = training_pipeline.with_options(
    run_name="custom_pipeline_run_name"
)
training_pipeline()
```

Pipeline run names must be unique, so if you plan to run your pipelines multiple times or run them on a schedule, make sure to either compute the run name dynamically or include one of the following placeholders that ZenML will replace:

* `{{date}}` will resolve to the current date, e.g. `2023_02_19`
* `{{time}}` will resolve to the current time, e.g. `11_07_09_326492`

```python
training_pipeline = training_pipeline.with_options(
    run_name=f"custom_pipeline_run_name_{{date}}_{{time}}"
)
training_pipeline()
```

Be sure to include the `f` string prefix to allow for the placeholders to be replaced, as shown in the example above. Without the `f` prefix, the placeholders will not be replaced.
